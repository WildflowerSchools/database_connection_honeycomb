# To do

* Move long fetch data query string inside function
* Move all functions inside classe
* Add ability to delete record by start, end, and object IDs
* Write docstrings
* Align parent and sibling classes
* Add DataQueue functionality to parent class
* Write tests for object time series database
* Use Honeycomb functionality to look up assignment by time rather than comparing times
* Use Honeycomb models/SDK instead of constructing raw queries/mutations
* Check whether query_expression_string works for all possible combinations field, operator, value, children (do commas work?)
* Extend to case of object database (configuration database)
* Align parent and sibling classes
* Write tests for object database
* Decide whether to include case of time series database without object (e.g., unidentified poses?)
